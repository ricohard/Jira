This is my learning Python project.

Part 1:
The idea is to connect into Jira and pull down attachments.

Part 2:
Pull out the data I actually care about and write it out.

Part 3:
Mail the data out.

Notes. I am rubbish at Python and I don't get the whole OO thing at all so this is going to be fun.
For various values of fun...
